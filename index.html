                The history of theatrical scenery is as old as the theatre itself, and just as obtuse and tradition

                painted to resemble a three-dimensional surface or vista, is a relatively recent innovation and a 
                significant departure from the more ancient forms of theatrical expression, which tended to rely 
                less on the actual representation of space senerial and more on the conveyance of action and mood.
